# Guide Efficiency Analysis

Analysis notebooks for quality control and guide efficiency assessment of a CRISPR Perturb-seq screen in macrophages (Ctrl vs LPS-stimulated conditions).

## Guide Assignment
Gaussian-Poisson mixed model was used to assign guide to cells. The cut off umi counts cut limits for a individual guides are recorded in csv file and for individual cells umi counts for guide assigned are recorded, (for multi guide cells, the guide with highest umi counts is recorded).

Input files : `<sample_name>_crispr_preprocessed.h5ad`
Output files: 	- file1: `{sample_name}_gex_guide.h5ad`
		- file2: `guide_assignment.csv`
		- file1: `guide_threshold.csv`
		- file1: `{sample_name_processed_guide.csv`


## Quality control: To check for guide efficiency, expression levels of perturbed genes were used to test statistics

Input files :`{sample_name}_gex_guide.h5ad`
Output files: `{sample_name}_guide_count_info.csv`

## Interactive visualization of Guide efficiency

## Data

All notebooks expect preprocessed `.h5ad` (AnnData) and `.csv` files organized under a shared project directory, with each sequencing lane stored in its own subfolder (`Mac_*`). Key input files per lane include:

- `*_gex_guide.h5ad` — gene expression + guide assignment per cell
- `*_crispr_preprocessed.h5ad` — CRISPR library UMI counts
- `*_guide_count_info.csv` — aggregate guide-level count statistics
- `*_cells_based_guide_efficiency.csv` — cell-level knockdown calls
- `experiment_info.csv` — lane/condition metadata

## Notebooks

### 1. `Guides_per_cell_distribution_plots.ipynb`

Visualizes how many sgRNA guides are detected per cell across conditions.

**What it does:**
- Reads guide assignment tables from each lane and splits by condition (Ctrl / LPS).
- Counts the number of guides assigned to each cell barcode.
- Generates a grouped bar chart (via `plotnine`) comparing the per-cell guide count distribution between Ctrl and LPS.

**Key output:** Bar plot of guide-per-cell distribution, saved to the `plots/` directory.

### 2. `Guide_type_distribuition_macs_ko.ipynb`

Characterizes the sgRNA assignment landscape and provides a broad QC overview of the screen.

**What it does:**
- Classifies every cell into an sgRNA category: *single sgRNA*, *single NTC sgRNA*, *multiple sgRNAs*, or *no sgRNA*.
- Plots stacked bar charts of sgRNA type composition per condition.
- Merges all lanes into a single AnnData object and generates dot plots of macrophage marker genes (e.g., CD14, CD68, IL1B, CCL2, CD163) across conditions.
- Computes per-condition summary statistics: mean mRNA UMIs/cell, mean genes/cell, mean % mitochondrial reads, mean guide UMI counts, and mean cells per guide.
- Produces a multi-panel bar chart summarizing these QC metrics.

**Key outputs:** sgRNA-type bar charts, marker gene dot plots, and a QC summary figure.

### 3. `QC_stats_MACS_with_cell_level_guide_efficiency.ipynb`

Quantifies guide-level and cell-level knockdown efficiency with statistical testing.

**What it does:**
- Aggregates guide count statistics across lanes (separately for Ctrl and LPS).
- For each targeting guide, computes a Welch's t-test of guide expression vs. NTC expression, derives log₂ fold-change, and applies Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction.
- Calculates cell-level knockdown rates: the fraction of cells carrying each guide where expression falls below the 5th percentile of the NTC distribution.
- Merges bulk and cell-level efficiency metrics and exports per-condition CSV files.
- Ranks target genes by baseline (NTC) expression and bins them to assess whether knockdown detection depends on expression level.
- Generates scatter plots of guide effect size vs. rank, cell-level knockdown fraction, and binned knockdown efficiency curves.

**Key outputs:** Guide efficiency CSVs (`Macs_Ctrl_cell_level_guide_efficiency.csv`, `Macs_LPS_cell_level_guide_efficiency.csv`), scatter plots, and rank-binned efficiency figures.
